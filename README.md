# LightModding (better name pending)

A Plugin for ChroMapper to assist in modding and in general giving feedback to a mapper.

## Known issues:
* Any text inputs that are 2 menus deep will not properly disable keybinds, making it nearly impossible to type. The workaround is to copy paste your text in instead. There seems to be a bug that is probably caused by me doing something wrong when i create a new dialog box when one is active.

## Currently done:
* main file creation features
* Multiple notes per entry
* main commenting features
* main review features - done except you cant access them after closing out yet
* saving to json
* autosaving a backup when unloading the editor
* automatically loading review files when found
* file versioning
* editing & deleting comments
* Exporting a review file to clipboard in (discord compatible) markdown

## Currently working on:
* note highlighting
* fixing the weird text input bug
* keybind for opening the reviews to make reviewing them accessible after creation/editing

## Planned features:
* Autosaving in intervals
* Save warning when quitting without saving instead of always creating a backup file
* prompting the user about the available review file instead of automatically loading it

## Wishful thinking:
* markers in the scrollbar (like bookmarks)
* Better UI
